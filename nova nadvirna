## Unique Value Offerings

SOLSTREAM is envisioned to bring the following **value offerings to blockchain world** and media industry.

![Value Offerings](./img/Slide02.png) 

It should be noted (as displayed in the legend) that some of the functionality is not yet implemented.  The figure shows the current functionalities implemented (black text) and the functionalities that are not yet implemented (gray text).


### Novelties:
1. Streaming of content in different channels through decentralized file storage on IPFS and smart contract on the Solana (SOL) blockchain (the latter to be implemented). Approval of advertisement content is decentralized through governance in a custom DAO (to be implemented).
2. Multiple blockchain project categories are to be integrated: NFT, DAO, streaming video, and e-commerce
Best of all worlds combined: Stunning user interface, Decentralization, Incorporation of Advertisement, Novel New-Age Channels (especially with Blockchain and Crypto focus)
3. Multiple channels, created within the hackathon duration, that compare to Theta.tv in magnitude, a project much older and bigger in size.
4. (Future implementation) Decentralized content creators getting rewarded through decentralized advertisements
5. (Future implementation) Owning shares of the channel and earning rewards for that ownership, even if not a governor.

### Meeting the Judging Criteria:
SOLSTREAM meets the [Judging Criteria](https://solana.com/riptide/faq) as described below. It should be noted that some of the functionality is not yet implemented, as shown earlier in the figure. 

**Functionality**
- Our project aims to develop the design and prototype of a television network, which stores content on IPFS and records contracts and other data openly on the Solana (SOL) blockchain network.
- The project aims to integrate multiple blockchain project categories, namely NFT, DAO, streaming video, and e-commerce, under a single operational framework, and implements this novel framework as a working dapp.
- Streaming of television channels is decentralized through Web 3.0 technology of IPFS.
- Approval of advertisement content will be decentralized through governance in a custom DAO.
- Best of all worlds will be combined: Stunning user interface, Decentralization, Incorporation of Advertisement, Novel New-Age Channels (especially with Blockchain and Crypto focus)
- Multiple streaming channels, created within the hackathon duration only, that readily compare in numbers/magnitude to Theta.tv, a project much older and bigger in size.

**Potential impact**
- Project is shared as open source under github, from which anyone can fork. This way, there can easily be a profiliration of a network of on-demand/live streaming/television networks, all under Solana (SOL).
- Project, when fully implemented, can enable many creators and participants (governors) to monetize on Web 3.0 through Solana (SOL).
- Project, when fully implemented, can enable many advertisers to market on Web 3.0 through Solana (SOL).
- Project can attract *many* people to blockchain and to the Solana (SOL) blockchain, significantly improving the visibility of Solana (SOL).
- Project can create *many* transactions on the Solana (SOL) blockchain, consuming Solana (SOL) tokens, and helping Solana (SOL) become less inflationary, and possibly deflationary in the future (Source: https://seekingalpha.com/article/4469557-solana-is-a-highly-undervalued-blockchain).

**Novelty**
- Project has a unique value offering, most importantly being the first of its kind, to our best knowledge.
- While there are competing projects that may have big improvements and advantages in the future, as of March 2022, we could not find a project that has what we propose/developed.
- The novelties of the project and benchmark with competing technologies/projects are presented in detail in the Appendix.

**Design + UX**
- Stunning user interface through effective use of React.js.
- User experience of the system can be experienced directly through the prototype system.
- Detailed documentation of the system design demonstrates the rigor put into the project.
- Coding best practices, such as consistent styles for naming and detailed in-code documentation, are implemented.
- Decentralized platforms (ex: IPFS) are preferred.

**Composability**
- The architecture of the system allows for modularity, with different components of the system coherent within, and linked to each other with properly defined links. 
- The system is documented in detail, illustrating the components of the system and their interactions.
- There is modularity also with respect to the profiliration of channel categories and channels in those categories: New channel categories and channels can be added, without disrupting the current content. 
	
**Business Plan**
- Financial Sustainability: Once smart contracts are implemented, part of the royalties from advertisements will flow into the project team's wallet, to enable future development.
- Social Sustainability: All stakeholders (initially, governors, creators, and project team) willl be rewarded and thus are motivated to grow the ecosystem and achieve network effects. Advertisers can be rewarded in the future with discounts.
- Future plans will be put under documentation.
